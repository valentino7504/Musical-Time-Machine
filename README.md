# Musical-Time-Machine
This project is one of my favourite projects. Scraping the Billboard Hot 100 songs for a user-specified date and creating a Spotify playlist for it.

## How It Works
It searches through a user-entered date and scrapes out the titles of all the Hot 100 songs for that date.
Using the Spotipy module, it gains access to the user's Spotify account and creates a playlist of as many of the Hot 100 tracks it can find on Spotify.
